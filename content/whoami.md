My name is Nikos Kormpakis and I'm from Greece, currently living in Athens. If
you're curious, my name in Greek is Νίκος Κορμπάκης.

My interests revolve around computing in general, especially infrastructure and
complex systems. When not messing around with computers, you will find me
shooting with my
[Nikon D7200](http://www.europe-nikon.com/en_GB/product/digital-cameras/slr/consumer/d7200),
DJing with my
[Pioneer DDJ SB2](https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/product/controller/ddj-sb2/black/overview/),
operating my U/V Amateur Radio transceivers as **SV1QYH**.

I currently work as a Systems Engineer at [GRNET](https://www.grnet.gr),
Greece's National Research and Educational Network. My team is involved with
the design and operation of our large-scale infrastructure and services,
including a public cloud ([~okeanos](https://okeanos.grnet.gr)), a number of
mission-critical services (ESA Copernicus, Greek Blood Donor Registry, etc),
and (lately), a number of public-facing services of the Public Sector. 

I also maintain a [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/nkorb) profile with more
details about my professional life, my previous jobs and more.

If you want to communicate with me, you can reach me at my personal email,
nkorb (+b) (a t) (google's)mail (ddott) com. I prefer plain text emails.

My name is Nikos Kormpakis and I'm from Greece, currently living in Athens. If
you're curious, my name in Greek is Νίκος Κορμπάκης.

My interests revolve around computing in general, especially infrastructure and
complex systems. When not messing around with computers, you will find me
shooting with my
[Nikon D7200](http://www.europe-nikon.com/en_GB/product/digital-cameras/slr/consumer/d7200),
DJing with my
[Pioneer DDJ SB2](https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/product/controller/ddj-sb2/black/overview/),
operating my noobish V/U Amateur Radio transceivers as **SV1QYH**, talking about
Greek politics and Free Software.

I currently work as a Systems and Service Engineer at the Greek Research and
Technology Network, [GRNET](https://grnet.gr). I'm part of GRNET's NOC Systems
Team, that designs and operates a wide portfolio of services for the Greek
research and academic community, using (almost!) only Free Software.

Also, I'm a student at the National Technical University of Athens, at the
[School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ntua.gr).

As a student, I got in touch with Free/Libre Software and became a member of
the [Free Software Community of NTUA (foss.ntua)](https://foss.ntua.gr).

I occasionally [tweet](https://twitter.com/nkorbbb) and upload some of my
photos on [500px](https://500px.com/nkorbb).

I also maintain a [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/nkorb) profile with more
details about my professional life.

If you want to communicate with me, you can reach me at my personal email,
nkorb (+b) (a t) (google's)mail (ddott) com. I prefer plain text emails.

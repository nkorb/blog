Before some months, I did a presentation on GRNET's Ceph deployments at theÂ 
[1st GEANT SIG-CISS meeting](https://wiki.geant.org/display/CISS/1st+SIG-CISS+meeting).
If you're interested on how we run Ceph (or maybe, how we used to run it in
September 2017), here are the slides of the presentation:
